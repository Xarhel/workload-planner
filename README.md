## Known issues
- Each employee can be assigned to one or multiple projects. EACH PROJECT HAS ITS OWN EMPLOYEE x LOAD association/link. Which means that if an employee is assigned 50% to one one project and 50% to another project, the "planning" view should display 100% for that same day. 
- Create a view to display in a table: the list of all employees, days, and weeks, for each employee, the list of eligible projects based on the employee's skills
