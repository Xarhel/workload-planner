## Known issues

- [x] There seem to be a problem when I add a new skill from the "Skills" view. It is as if it isn't recognized correctly when I go to the projectAdvancedView view, as the employee with this skill isn't suggested.

- [ ] Rename the "planning" view to "Workload overview" or something similar, as this better reflects the purpose of this view.
